`cxa` is a fast CLI for switching between multiple ChatGPT accounts in Codex
and viewing each account's quota.

It uses Codex's normal credential file, so you can keep launching Codex exactly
as you do today.

## Demo

Install `cxa`, import the current Codex login, load every account's quota in
parallel, and switch accounts:

## Requirements

- The [Codex CLI](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli) installed and
  available as `codex`
- A ChatGPT OAuth login; API-key authentication is not supported
- macOS or Linux

## Install

### Homebrew (recommended)

Homebrew installs the matching prebuilt binary on macOS or Linux. Linux users
can install Homebrew by following the official
[Homebrew on Linux guide](https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-on-Linux).

```sh
brew install jesse-merhi/tap/cxa
cxa init
```

### Prebuilt binary

Download the archive for your operating system and CPU from
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/jesse-merhi/cxa/releases/latest), extract
it, then run the included installer:

```sh
./install.sh
~/.local/bin/cxa init
```

The installer copies `cxa` to `~/.local/bin`. Add that directory to `PATH` if
it is not already available in your shell. Linux binaries require glibc 2.35
or newer.

### Build from source

Requires Rust 1.85 or newer.

```sh
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/jesse-merhi/cxa --bin cxa
cxa init
```

Windows is not currently supported.

## Quick start

Make sure Codex is signed in with ChatGPT OAuth, then import that account:

```sh
cxa init
```

If Codex is not signed in yet, run `codex login` first. Codex uses the file
credential store by default; the [credential storage](#credential-storage)
section covers custom configurations.

Add another account. `cxa` will open the normal Codex login flow:

```sh
cxa add
```

List your accounts and their latest known quota:

```sh
cxa list
```

Switch accounts by number or by a unique part of the email address:

```sh
cxa 2
cxa use work@example.com
```

Restart any running Codex or ChatGPT session after switching so it loads the
new account.

## Example

```text
$ cxa list
* 1  personal@example.com  Pro 20x · updated just now
    Codex
      Weekly   [█████████████░░░]  82% left  resets in 6d 11h
    Codex Spark
      5-hour   [█████████░░░░░░░]  59% left  resets in 4h 12m
      Weekly   [███████████████░]  91% left  resets in 6d 23h

  2  work@example.com  Pro 20x · updated just now
    Codex
      Weekly   [██████░░░░░░░░░░]  37% left  resets in 3d 8h
    Codex Spark
      5-hour   [████████████████] 100% left  resets in 4h 48m
      Weekly   [██████████████░░]  88% left  resets in 5d 17h

$ cxa 2
✓ Account 2 (work@example.com) is now selected.
! Restart Codex or ChatGPT before expecting an existing session to use this account.
```

The `*` marks the account currently selected in Codex.

When quota data is stale, an interactive terminal immediately lists every
account with an animated loading indicator, fetches them in parallel, and fills
each account in as it responds. Redirected output skips the live display and
prints the completed list once.

Keep the dashboard open with `cxa watch`. It refreshes every 60 seconds; use
`--interval SECONDS` to change the cadence, and press `q` or Ctrl-C to exit.
`cxa list --watch` remains available as the explicit form.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `cxa` | Show the selected account and credential state |
| `cxa init` | Import the current Codex login as account 1 |
| `cxa add` | Sign in and add another account |
| `cxa add --device-auth` | Add an account with Codex's device-code flow |
| `cxa list` | List accounts and their latest known quota |
| `cxa watch` | Keep the live quota dashboard open |
| `cxa watch --interval 30` | Refresh every 30 seconds |
| `cxa list --watch` | Open watch mode through `list` |
| `cxa <account>` | Switch by account number or email |
| `cxa use <account>` | Switch using the explicit command form |
| `cxa status` | Show the selected account and credential state |
| `cxa relogin <account>` | Re-authenticate a saved account |
| `cxa import <auth.json>` | Import an existing Codex credential file |

Use `cxa --help` or `cxa <command> --help` for the complete CLI reference.

## How it works

Each account is stored as a profile under `~/.codex-auth`. When you switch,
`cxa` atomically copies that profile to `$CODEX_HOME/auth.json`, which is the
standard file-backed credential store used by Codex.

Codex keeps credentials in memory while it is running. Switching is safe, but
an existing Codex or ChatGPT process will continue using its previous account
until you restart it.

To read quota, `cxa` runs `codex app-server` with the saved account in an
isolated temporary home. This does not change the selected account. Codex owns
OAuth token refresh; if it refreshes a token during a quota read, `cxa` verifies
the account identity before saving the updated credentials.

Account identity includes the ChatGPT user ID and, when available, the
workspace ID. Accounts and workspaces that share an email address remain
distinct.

## Credential storage

`cxa` supports Codex's default file-backed credential store. If you configured
`cli_auth_credentials_store` as `keyring`, `auto`, or `ephemeral`, change it to
`file` and run `codex login` again before using `cxa`:

```toml
# ~/.codex/config.toml
cli_auth_credentials_store = "file"
```

If an account's refresh token is no longer valid, re-authenticate it:

```sh
cxa relogin <account>
```

## Configuration

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `CODEX_HOME` | Override the Codex home directory |
| `CXA_ACCOUNT_STORE` | Override the account profile directory |
| `CXA_CODEX_BIN` | Override the Codex executable used for login and quota reads |
| `CXA_USAGE_TTL` | Set the quota cache lifetime in seconds (default: `120`) |
| `CXA_SKIP_USAGE_REFRESH=1` | Show cached quota without refreshing it |

Values supplied to path variables must be absolute.

For non-interactive setup, use `cxa init --yes`.

## Development

```sh
./scripts/check.sh
cargo build --locked --release --bin cxa
```

CI checks formatting, Clippy, tests, release packaging, and Linux and macOS
builds. Version tags publish native archives and update
[`jesse-merhi/homebrew-tap`](https://github.com/jesse-merhi/homebrew-tap).
